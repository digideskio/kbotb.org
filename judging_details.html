                <h3>Qualifications</h3>
                <p><b>Steward:</b>
                Stewards are responsible for keeping the judges supplied with the supplies they need (especially beer) throughout the contest, and for problem-solving any issues that come up.
                Stewards will begin the day by helping to organize the materials, and once the judging begins will be assigned a to serve a single table of judges.
                No special skills are required to be a steward.
                Just be on site and ready to pitch in with whatever needs doing.
                
                <p><b>Judge:</b>
                Judges are responsible for evaluating a series of entries according to BJCP guidelines.
                We welcome inexperienced or even first-time judges, who will be partnered with more experienced judges to ensure a fair evaluation of all entries.
                Judges should be <em>familiar</em> with the 2015 BCJP guidelines and the process of evaluating beer.
                Please contact the judge coordinator (listed above) with any questions about your qualifications.
