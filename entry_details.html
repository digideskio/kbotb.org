                <ul>
                    <li>Two (2) bottles or one pressurized soda bottle with "carbonator".

                    <li>A completed competition entry form which can be printed from the registration web site.</li>

                </ul>

                <p>For your entry to do best, be sure to supply all of the required information and as much optional information as is appropriate for the style. Refer to the <b>2015</b> BJCP Style Guidelines for the styles that require or may benefit from additional information and for the specific information required. Failure to supply required information such as Classic Style, Special Ingredients, or Carbonation Level (mead, cider) will negatively impact the scoring of your entry. For any questions about the entry form, the style guidelines, classifying an entry, or supplying additional information, please contact the Competition Registrar.

                <p>Bottles will not be returned.

                <h4>Packing and Shipping</h4>

                <p>Carefully pack your entries in a sturdy box. Line the inside of your carton with a plastic trash bag. Partition and pack each bottle with adequate packaging material. Do not over pack! Write clearly: "Fragile. This Side Up." on the package. Your package should weigh less than 25 pounds. Please refrain from using "messy" packaging materials such a Styrofoam "peanuts" or pellets; please use packaging material such as bubble wrap.

                <p>Enclose each of of your bottle labels in a small zip-top bag before attaching to their respective bottles with a rubber band. This makes it possible for the organizer to identify specifically which beer has broken if there is damage during shipment.  The labels must be removed before judging, so do not tape or glue to the bottle.

                <p>Every reasonable effort will be made to contact entrants whose bottles have broken to make arrangements for sending replacement bottles.

                <p>It is not against any Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) regulations or federal laws to ship your entries via privately owned shipping company for analytical purposes. However, IT IS ILLEGAL TO SHIP ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES VIA THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE. Private shipping companies have the right to refuse your shipment if they are informed that the package contains glass and/or alcoholic beverages. Be aware that entries mailed internationally are often required by customs to have proper documentation. These entries might be opened and/or returned to the shipper by customs' officials at their discretion. It is solely the entrant's responsibility to follow all applicable laws and regulations.

                <p>Mail your entry to

                <address>
